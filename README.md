# Space Tourism

This project builds on top of the following [course](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel). The purpose of the course is to setup a CSS design system starting from scratch, following Figma sketches provided as an input. The website is fully responsive to different screen sizes.

Instead of following the course approach, an Astro based project is provided here.

The final website is deployed at the following [link](https://dashing-lamington-170ab0.netlify.app/).

_Please note: the page "Technology" has not been implemented._
